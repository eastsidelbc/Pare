## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **Critical: Per-Game Ranking Precision Fix** (2025-10-09) âœ… COMPLETE
  - See: `docs/devnotes/2025-10-09-hooks-alignment-audit.md`
  - See: `docs/audits/2025-10-cross-surface-hooks/findings.md`
  - **Issue**: `.toFixed(1)` was rounding values BEFORE ranking computation
  - **Root Cause**: `utils/teamDataTransform.ts:54` converted per-game values to strings (e.g., 38.888 â†’ "38.9")
  - **Impact**: Broke tie detection in per-game mode - Vikings showed "15th" instead of "T-13th"
  - **Fix**: Removed `.toFixed(1)` from data transform layer
  - **Result**: Full precision preserved for ranking, formatting only at display layer
  - Affects both desktop AND mobile (shared bug)
  - No other code changes needed (display components already format correctly)
  - Per-game and Total modes now have identical tie detection precision
- **Mobile Dropdown Positioning - Floating UI Migration** (2025-10-09) âœ… COMPLETE

  - See: `docs/audits/2025-10-09-mobile-dropdown-audit.md`
  - **Issue #1 Fixed**: Dropdowns no longer clipped by panel divider/overflow-hidden
  - **Issue #2 Fixed**: Right-side (Team B) dropdowns stay within viewport  
  - **Issue #3 Fixed**: Bottom row dropdowns auto-flip to render above when needed
  - **Positioning Enhancement**: Smart side positioning - Team A dropdowns appear RIGHT, Team B dropdowns appear LEFT
  - **Height Fix**: Shows 8-9 complete rows (416-468px) instead of 5.38 rows - no more mid-row cutoff (San Francisco issue)
  - Migrated from manual absolute positioning to industry-standard **Floating UI** library
