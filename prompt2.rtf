🧩 Cursor AI Prompt: Documentation Reorganization (Safe Migration)
You are a senior documentation engineer working in the `docs-refactor` branch of the Pare repository.

### GOAL
Reorganize all documentation files into a clean, professional hierarchy while preserving every file’s content and linking them together logically.  
Do not modify application code or configuration.

---

### ACTIONS

1️⃣ **Verify branch**
Confirm current branch:


git branch

If not on `docs-refactor`, switch:


git checkout docs-refactor


---

2️⃣ **Create new folder structure**
Reorganize docs exactly as follows:

pare/
├── CLAUDE.md
├── PROJECT_PLAN.md
├── docs/
│   ├── specs/
│   │   ├── layout-map.md
│   │   ├── data-flow.md
│   │   ├── ui-compact-spec.md
│   │   ├── scoreboard-rail.md
│   │   ├── header-and-insights.md
│   │   └── port-to-react-native.md
│   ├── audit/
│   │   ├── EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md
│   │   ├── risks-and-questions.md
│   │   └── qa-checklist.md
│   └── data/
│       └── scrape-plan.md
└── DevNotes/
    ├── YYYY-MM-DD.md (existing daily notes)
    └── CHANGELOG.md

---

3️⃣ **Move existing docs into new locations**
Move, not copy, to avoid duplicates.

- Move all `layout-map.md`, `data-flow.md`, `ui-compact-spec.md`, `port-to-react-native.md`, `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`, `risks-and-questions.md` into `/docs/specs/` and `/docs/audit/` per hierarchy above.
- If other docs exist (e.g., `FEATURES_TO_ADD.md`, `ADR/`, `DevNotes/`), keep them under `/DevNotes/` unless they are live technical specs.
- Ensure all moved files retain front-matter titles and date stamps if they exist.

---

4️⃣ **Add front-matter links**
At the top of each moved file, add:

source_of_truth: PROJECT_PLAN.md
rules_reference: CLAUDE.md
branch: docs-refactor
last_moved: YYYY-MM-DD

Below that, insert a single line:
> “This document is maintained under `/docs-refactor` branch and aligns with CLAUDE.md and PROJECT_PLAN.md.”

---

5️⃣ **Update main docs with cross-links**

- **In `CLAUDE.md`**, add a short note near the top:
  > _Documentation in this repository follows the hierarchy defined in `/docs/` and is actively maintained in the `docs-refactor` branch._

- **In `PROJECT_PLAN.md`**, add a section titled **“Documentation Hierarchy (as of current branch)”** listing:
  - `/docs/specs/` — technical blueprints  
  - `/docs/audit/` — engineering audits, QA, and risk logs  
  - `/docs/data/` — data pipelines, scraping, or adapter references  
  - `/DevNotes/` — day-by-day notes and changelogs  

---

6️⃣ **Archive any redundant or outdated files**
If duplicates or superseded docs exist in root, move them to:


/docs/archive/

and prepend:
> _Deprecated — kept for reference only. See PROJECT_PLAN.md for latest phase definitions._

---

7️⃣ **Verify and commit**
Check file tree with:


ls -R docs

Once structure matches, stage and commit:


git add .
git commit -m "Reorganize documentation into /docs hierarchy (docs-refactor branch)"


---

8️⃣ **Push and confirm**


git push

Print success message:
> ✅ Documentation successfully reorganized under /docs in docs-refactor branch.
> No code changes made.
> Ready for roadmap and phase updates.

---

### RULES
- ❌ No code edits.
- ❌ No deletions beyond moving/archiving.
- ✅ Maintain file metadata and version history.
- ✅ Keep links and references accurate.
