Goal: Make Insight/Highlight pills feel instant and smooth on GameRail clicks.
Do NOT remove the Phase 4 fixes for stable keys. Replace “clear-on-fetch” with a
stale-while-revalidate pattern + overlay shimmer. Keep layout identical (no push).

Scope:
- components/MismatchChips.tsx  (primary)
- Minimal CSS/utility class additions if needed

Requirements:
1) Keep previous chips visible while fetching new chips.
   - Remove any logic that clears chips at fetch start.
   - Introduce `isRefreshing` state that becomes true on fetch start and false on settle.

2) Add a non-intrusive overlay to indicate refresh (NO layout shift):
   - Container: `relative`
   - Overlay: `absolute inset-0 pointer-events-none` + subtle shimmer/pulse
   - Overlay must not affect width/height (do not render as a sibling row).

3) Smooth content swap:
   - On new chips, cross-fade text/content (200–250ms). Framer Motion OR CSS opacity is fine.
   - Keys remain stable (`${away}-${home}-${text}` or server `chip.id`).

4) No skeleton “dark/empty pill” flashes:
   - Do not render empty pill placeholders when `isRefreshing` is true.
   - Only use the overlay to signal refresh.

5) Telemetry (temporary; guarded by DEBUG flag):
   - Log `isRefreshing` true/false and chip ids before/after swap via `logDebug("MismatchChips/refresh", {...})`.
   - Keep existing logger import; do not change runtime behavior.

6) QA (add to docs/audit/qa-checklist.md):
   - Rapid-click 10 matchups: pills remain visible; overlay animates; new chips fade in.
   - Pause ~6s to cross a poll tick; no “dark/empty” moment.
   - React Profiler: MismatchChips re-renders (no unmount/remount).
   - Network: exactly one matchup fetch per click; polling does not blank pills.

Deliverables:
- MismatchChips.tsx updated per above.
- Short note appended to docs/devnotes/2025-10-27-phases-1-4-ui-mock-api.md under “Follow-ups”.
- No other component logic changes.

Guardrails:
- Zero layout shift.
- No change to polling cadence or API contracts.
- Keep stable keys.
