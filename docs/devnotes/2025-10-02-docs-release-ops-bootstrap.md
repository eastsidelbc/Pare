**Normative rules live in CLAUDE.md §Changelog Guidelines. This note records implementation details and rationale.**

### 1) Context & Goal
- Establish docs/release ops scaffolding aligned to CLAUDE norms: Dev Notes, CHANGELOG, and cross-linking.

### 2) Decisions & Alternatives
- Decision: Create Dev Note structure and minimal Keep a Changelog file; treat CLAUDE.md as normative.
- Alternatives considered: Defer changelog creation until next code change (rejected—normative process requires immediate setup).

### 3) Implementation Notes (algorithms, constants, config keys)
- Files created: `docs/devnotes/2025-10-02-docs-release-ops-bootstrap.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` (root), `docs/adr/_template.md`.
- Link conventions: Use root `CLAUDE.md#changelog-guidelines` anchor; no duplication of normative content.
- Anchors: Prefer stable section headings in CLAUDE for deep links.

### 4) Testing & Acceptance Criteria
- Dev Note present under `docs/devnotes/` with today’s date and kebab title.
- Dev Note links to `CLAUDE.md#changelog-guidelines`.
- `CHANGELOG.md` includes an [Unreleased] → Docs entry linking to this Dev Note.
- No architecture or runtime changes.

### 5) Performance & Limitations
- Documentation-only; zero runtime impact.

### 6) Follow-ups
- Add `/api/health` endpoint per CLAUDE Phase 0 checklist.
- Reconcile `RankingDropdown` status in `CLAUDE.md` to a single authoritative statement.
- Create ADR if future changes affect architecture.

### 7) Graduated to CLAUDE (what got promoted + date)
- None for this task (process bootstrap). Add bullets and promotion date when patterns are promoted.
