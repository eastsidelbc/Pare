# 🏈 Pare: NFL Team Comparison Platform

## 📋 **Project Overview**

**Pare** is a professional NFL team comparison platform providing real-time statistical analysis with advanced per-game calculations. Built with Next.js 14/15 and optimized for self-hosting on M1 Mac with PM2.

**🎯 PRIMARY STRATEGIC GOAL**: While currently a web application, the **biggest objective is to convert this to a native iOS app for the App Store**. The web app serves as the foundation and proof-of-concept, with the ultimate goal being to learn Swift and create a native mobile experience that leverages the existing API infrastructure and sophisticated data processing logic.

### **Core Features**
- **Interactive Comparison**: Visual side-by-side team analysis with dynamic bars
- **Per-Game Intelligence**: Smart calculations showing meaningful per-game vs total stats  
- **Unlimited Customization**: Choose any metrics from Pro Football Reference's dataset (44+ metrics with enhanced defense options)
- **Real-Time Data**: Current 2025 NFL season stats with comprehensive metrics
- **Context-Aware Display**: Smart metric interpretation for offense vs defense perspectives
- **Self-Hosted Control**: Complete data ownership and customization freedom
- **Mobile-Ready Architecture**: Designed to support future native iOS app development

## 🧭 **How The Project Works (Simple Explanation)**

### **Data Flow Architecture**
```
Pro Football Reference CSV Files → Local Storage → API Routes → JSON Response → React Hooks → UI Components → Visual Comparison
```

**Step-by-Step:**
1. **Data Source**: Manual CSV exports from Pro Football Reference (offense-2025.csv, defense-2025.csv)
2. **API Processing**: Two Next.js API routes (`/api/nfl-2025/offense`, `/api/nfl-2025/defense`) parse CSV using position-based column mapping
3. **React Hooks**: `useNflStats` fetches data, `useRanking` calculates team rankings, `useDisplayMode` handles per-game/total toggle
4. **Components**: `ComparePage` orchestrates everything, `OffensePanel`/`DefensePanel` display comparisons, `DynamicComparisonRow` renders individual metrics
5. **Visualization**: `useBarCalculation` creates proportional bars, `useTheme` handles colors/styling

### **Key Components & Hooks**
- **`ComparePage`**: Main orchestrator, manages global team selection state
- **`OffensePanel`/`DefensePanel`**: Self-contained sections with team logos, metrics, and comparisons  
- **`DynamicComparisonRow`**: Individual metric comparison with interactive ranking dropdowns
- **`useNflStats`**: Fetches and caches NFL data from API endpoints
- **`useRanking`**: Client-side ranking calculations (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.) with tie handling
- **`useDisplayMode`**: Toggles between per-game and total stats with smart field detection
- **`useTheme`**: Dynamic color schemes and styling system

### **File Structure Logic**

## 📋 **Development Rules & Constraints**

### **Architecture Principles**
- **Keep logic simple and global**: Avoid unnecessary abstraction layers
- **Preserve existing structure**: Do not change the current architecture or add complexity
- **Component separation**: Each panel is self-contained with clear responsibilities
- **Hook-based logic**: Business logic lives in custom hooks, components focus on UI
- **No breaking changes**: Always maintain backward compatibility

### **Code Guidelines**
- **TypeScript everywhere**: Full type safety, no `any` types
- **Client-side ranking**: Use `useRanking` hook, avoid server-side calculations
- **Position-based CSV mapping**: Never change the CSV column mapping without updating both offense/defense APIs
- **Error boundaries**: All major components wrapped in error handling
- **Performance first**: Memoization, caching, efficient calculations

### **Data Management Rules**
- **CSV as source of truth**: Manual exports from Pro Football Reference
- **6-hour caching**: API responses cached for performance
- **Per-game calculations**: Applied at UI level, not API level
- **Ranking consistency**: Rankings calculated client-side for accuracy

### **PROJECT_PLAN.md Maintenance Rules**
- **Living Document**: Always update PROJECT_PLAN.md after every session with changes, progress, and discoveries
- **Single Source of Truth**: This file contains all current project status, rules, and future plans
- **Session Updates**: Add to changelog what was accomplished, what issues were found, what's next
- **Future Planning**: Keep detailed future plans and work-in-progress sections updated
- **Clean but Complete**: Remove redundancy but preserve important technical details and context
- **Carry Forward Context**: When opening new sessions, read and update this file to maintain continuity
- **Consistency with CLAUDE.md**: Both files should reflect the same version and session information

### **🚨 CRITICAL Architecture Guardrails (NEVER VIOLATE)**

#### **Preserve Existing Architecture**
- **DO NOT change the current modular architecture** - it's professionally designed and production-tested
- **DO NOT add unnecessary complexity** - keep solutions simple and aligned with existing patterns
- **ALWAYS check previous logic** before implementing new features - understand why things work the way they do
- **MAINTAIN global logic and behavior** - don't fragment or duplicate state management
- **NO interference with existing systems** - new code should integrate seamlessly without disrupting current functionality
- **DOUBLE CHECK everything** - verify changes don't break existing functionality, test thoroughly

#### **Global Logic & Behavior Preservation**
- **NEVER duplicate state management** - team selection happens ONLY at ComparePage level
- **RESPECT existing data flow** - components receive data via props, don't fetch independently
- **MAINTAIN hook contracts** - custom hooks have established APIs, don't change their signatures
- **PRESERVE component isolation** - OffensePanel and DefensePanel are self-contained, keep it that way
- **NO side effects** - new code shouldn't cause unexpected behavior in unrelated components
- **CONSISTENT user experience** - changes should feel natural within existing interface patterns

#### **Before Making ANY Changes - Mandatory Checklist**
- [ ] **Read PROJECT_PLAN.md** for current status and context
- [ ] **Understand existing logic** - why does the current implementation work this way?
- [ ] **Check for similar patterns** - is there already a solution for this problem?
- [ ] **Verify no interference** - will this change affect other components?
- [ ] **Test backwards compatibility** - do existing features still work?
- [ ] **Follow existing conventions** - naming, structure, patterns
- [ ] **Performance impact** - does this maintain current speed?
- [ ] **Global behavior check** - does this maintain consistent user experience?
- [ ] **State management review** - does this respect the single source of truth pattern?
- [ ] **Documentation needed** - update both PROJECT_PLAN.md and CLAUDE.md after changes

## 🛠️ **Technical Architecture**

### **Technology Stack**
- **Framework**: Next.js 14/15 + App Router + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v3 with premium effects
- **Data**: CSV parsing with position-based column mapping
- **Hosting**: M1 Mac + PM2 (24/7 uptime)
- **Caching**: 6-hour in-memory cache

### **theScore Bar Visualization System**
```typescript
// Perfect proportional calculation
const teamAPercentage = (teamAValue / (teamAValue + teamBValue)) * 100;
const teamBPercentage = (teamBValue / (teamAValue + teamBValue)) * 100;

// Visual result: Bars always meet in center, showing exact performance ratio
```

**Visual Excellence:**
- **Inward Growth**: Left bar extends right, right bar extends left
- **Perfect Connection**: Mathematical precision ensures bars meet in center
- **Instant Understanding**: Longer bar = better performance
- **Professional Polish**: Smooth animations and broadcast-quality styling

### **CSV Processing Innovation**

**Position-Based Column Mapping:**
```typescript
// Problem: CSV has duplicate "Yds" columns
// Solution: Map by exact position instead of header name

const CSV_COLUMN_MAPPING_BY_POSITION = {
  3: 'points',           // PF = Points For
  4: 'total_yards',      // Yds = TOTAL YARDS (position 4)
  12: 'pass_yds',        // Yds = PASSING YARDS (position 12) 
  18: 'rush_yds',        // Yds = RUSHING YARDS (position 18)
  21: 'rush_fd',         // 1stD = Rushing First Downs
  27: 'exp_pts_tot'      // EXP = Expected Points
};
```

### **Smart Per-Game Calculation Engine**
```typescript
// Per-game calculation logic
const calculatePerGameStats = (teamData, mode) => {
  if (mode === 'total' || !teamData?.g) return teamData;
  
  const games = parseFloat(teamData.g) || 1;
  
  // Convert totals to per-game (exclude percentages/rates)
  Object.keys(teamData).forEach(key => {
    if (!key.includes('pct') && !key.includes('per') && isNumeric(teamData[key])) {
      teamData[key] = (parseFloat(teamData[key]) / games).toFixed(1);
    }
  });
  
  return teamData;
};
```

### **Rank-Based Dramatic Amplification System**

**Dynamic Bar Amplification Based on NFL Rankings:**
```javascript
// Calculate rank gap between teams
const rankGap = Math.abs(teamARank - teamBRank);

// Determine amplification factor based on gap size
let amplificationFactor = 1.2; // Base factor for close matches

if (rankGap >= 20) {
  amplificationFactor = 2.5; // EXTREME difference
} else if (rankGap >= 15) {
  amplificationFactor = 2.2; // HUGE difference  
} else if (rankGap >= 10) {
  amplificationFactor = 1.8; // BIG difference
} else if (rankGap >= 5) {
  amplificationFactor = 1.5; // MODERATE difference
} else {
  amplificationFactor = 1.2; // SUBTLE difference
}

// Elite vs Poor Bonus: Top 5 vs Bottom 10 teams
const eliteVsPoorBonus = (teamAIsElite && teamBIsPoor) || 
                        (teamBIsElite && teamAIsPoor) ? 0.5 : 0;
amplificationFactor += eliteVsPoorBonus;

// Apply exponential scaling
const amplifiedRatioA = Math.pow(baseRatioA, amplificationFactor);
const amplifiedRatioB = Math.pow(baseRatioB, amplificationFactor);
```

**Amplification Philosophy:**
- **League Position Matters More Than Raw Values**: A 1st-ranked defense gets a huge bar, 31st-ranked gets tiny bar
- **Psychologically Accurate**: Reflects how fans perceive team strength differences
- **Visually Dramatic**: Makes elite teams look truly elite, creates instant understanding
- **Maximum 3.0x Amplification**: For elite vs poor matchups (Top 5 vs Bottom 10 + rank gap 20+)

# 🚀 Comprehensive Roadmap — Web + Mobile + App Store

## Phase 0: Foundations (Repo + Hosting)
- Confirm CLAUDE.md as Source of Truth (rules + rituals)
- Organize docs: move PROJECT_PLAN.md → docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md, Mobile_plan.md → docs/MOBILE_PLAN.md.
- Repo hygiene: single lockfile (package-lock.json), add .cursorrules
- Add MOBILE_NOTES.md (API contracts, caching, errors)
- Add SECURITY.md (scope, no secrets)
- Implement /api/health → { ok: true, version }
- Manual push workflow: git pull + build on Mac mini
- Domain + Cloudflare Tunnel setup (beta may use trycloudflare.com)

**Check-in:** 
- Do we attach domain now or test first with tunnel link?
- Do you want me to also scaffold ADR templates + Dev Notes folders now?
- Are you ready to attach your Cloudflare domain yet, or stick with trycloudflare.com first?

---

## Phase 1: Web Deploy (Beta Hosting)
🔹 Goal: Public “beta” version running on your Mac mini with a clean domain.

- Cloudflare Tunnel maps domain (pare.mydomain.com) → Mac mini
- HTTPS access, marked “beta” in UI
- Expose /compare?home=X&away=Y for deep linking (needed for Swift + share sheet).
- Deep links (/compare?home=X&away=Y) for iOS integration
- Continue manual pushes; optional deploy.sh script

**Check-in:** Mac mini as long-term host or temporary until Vercel/Railway?

---

## Phase 2: Continuous Web Iteration
🔹 Goal: Improve core web app UI + data contracts while live.

- Improve UI polish: animations, responsive Tailwind, mobile layout
- Lock API contracts: Team, Metric, CompareResult
- Add caching headers (ETag/Cache-Control)
- Expand metrics (flag advanced as “experimental”/“premium”)
- Keep Dev Notes + CHANGELOG updated

**Check-in:** 
- Automate CSV ingestion now or after Swift work?
- Do you want to start automating CSV ingestion now (cron/Python scraper), or hold until after Swift work begins?
- Should we gate experimental stats behind a feature flag system in the API?

## Phase 3: Swift App Bootstrap (Companion)
🔹 Goal: Build native SwiftUI app targeting iOS 17, consuming live API.

- Create ios/ folder: README, QA.md, Config.xcconfig
- Add StatsAPI.swift fetches API endpoints (fetch /api/compare, /api/teams, /api/metrics, /api/health etc.)
- CompareView: team pickers, inward bars, live data
- Persist last selections, error/retry UI
- Internal TestFlight build

**Check-in:** 
- Do you want Swift app to mirror web UI exactly, or evolve a slightly different UX optimized for mobile?
- Do you want to set portrait-only orientation for v1?

## Phase 4: Premium Layer + Mobile Features
🔹 Goal: Begin paywall + iOS integrations (companion evolving toward replacement).

- Identify premium features: advanced stats, historical data, alerts, future AI predictions on games
- Feature flags in API for free vs premium
- Settings screen (theme, refresh policy, defaults)
- Share Sheet + universal links
- Optional: Siri Shortcuts

**Check-in:** In-App Purchases via App Store, or Stripe later?

---

## Phase 5: App Store Readiness
🔹 Goal: Move from “companion beta” → polished replacement candidate.

- Accessibility: VoiceOver, Dynamic Type
- Performance: cold start, animations, caching
- App icons, splash, Privacy manifest
- QA matrix across devices (iOS 17+)
- App Store metadata, screenshots, TestFlight → review

**Check-in:** iPhone only or iPad support too?

---

## Phase 6: Expansion (Android + More)
🔹 Goal: Reach all users + expand ecosystem.

- Android build (Compose, Flutter, or React Native)
- Push notifications (premium alerts)
- Widgets (favorite teams, standings)
- Continuous monetization tuning

**Check-in:** Native Android vs cross-platform strategy?

🎯 End State

- Web app: hosted via Cloudflare → domain, stable API, continuously updated.
- iOS app: SwiftUI native, polished, App Store-ready, premium features behind paywall.
- Android app: follows iOS, powered by same backend API.
- Docs: CLAUDE.md rules enforced, Dev Notes + ADRs cross-linked, CHANGELOG maintained.
- Future: move hosting from Mac mini → managed infra (Vercel/Railway), automate CSV ingestion, scale features + premium.
